; Huge thanks to 'GitJer' on GitHub for writing this PIO and giving me a starting point for the PWM input code!
; Check them out here: https://github.com/GitJer/Some_RPI-Pico_stuff/tree/main/PwmIn/PwmIn_4pins
.program pwm

; algorithm:

; loop:
;    reset y, the 'timer' for the pulsewidth (high period)
;    reset x, the 'timer' for the low period. (high + low = period)
;    wait for a 0, then wait for a 1: this is the rising edge
;    loop: 
;       decrement y timer
;       test for falling edge 
;    y timer value is the pulse width (actually, (0xFFFFFFFF - y)*2/125MHz is the pulse width)
;    loop:
;       test for rising edge
;       decrement x timer
;    x timer is the low period (actually, (0xFFFFFFFF - x)*2/125MHz is the low period)
;    push both y and x to the Rx FIFO
;    notify via relative IRQ

.wrap_target
start:
    mov y ~NULL         ; start with the value 0xFFFFFFFF
    mov x ~NULL         ; start with the value 0xFFFFFFFF
    wait 0 pin 0        ; wait for a 0
    wait 1 pin 0        ; wait for a 1, now we really have the rising edge
timer_hp:               ; loop for high period
    jmp y-- test        ; count down for pulse width
    jmp start           ; timer has reached 0, stop count down of pulse, restart
test:
    jmp pin timer_hp    ; test if the pin is still 1, if so, continue counting down
timer_lp:               ; loop for low period
    jmp pin timerstop   ; if the pin has become 1, the period is over, stop count down
    jmp x-- timer_lp    ; if not: count down
    jmp start           ; timer has reached 0, stop count down of low period, restart
timerstop:
    mov ISR ~y          ; move the value ~y to the ISR: the high period (pulsewidth) (0xFFFFFFFF-y)
    push noblock        ; push the ISR into the Rx FIFO
    mov ISR ~x          ; move the value ~x to the ISR: the low period (0xFFFFFFFF-x)
    push noblock        ; push the ISR into the Rx FIFO
    irq 0 rel           ; notify the c-program via IRQ
.wrap
