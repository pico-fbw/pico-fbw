# pico-fbw TODO

[ ] LED STRIPS FOR GAMER PLANE YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[ ] thrust control (maybe not automatic yet, just manual and allow through api)
[ ] support more IMU types
[ ] better autotune
[ ] speed (per waypoint) in auto mode
[ ] better wi-fly with pi0 (uploads flightplans over api)
[ ] read battery voltage through ADC (and respective api call)

there are also more misc TODOs throughout the files with more dire issues to be added and fixed
those have priority, this is more of a feature wishlist
